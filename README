lv2dynparam is a LV2 plugin interface extension that enables plugin
parameters to appear and disappear (i.e. number of voices). It also
allows nested grouping of parameters. Groups can be used for things
like ADSR abstraction, i.e. group of 4 float parameters.

The extension consists of a header describing the extension interface
and libraries, one for plugins and one for hosts, to expose
functionality in more usable, from programmer point of view,
interface.

The extension has been initially created to allow exposing the full
functionality of the zynadd LV2 plugin (part of the zyn project) and
to allow generic UI - provided by a host (zynjacku). The extension
allows but does not requires generic UI. Plugin writters are free to
provide custom UI for their plugin.

The extension should be suitable for all plugins that expose many
and/or complex data types, like samplers, non-trivial synths, etc.

This library is work in progress. Any help is appreciated.
